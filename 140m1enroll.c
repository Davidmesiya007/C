Problem
------------------------------------------------------------------------
For the upcoming semester, the admins of your university decided 
to keep a total of XX seats for the MATH-1 course. A student interest 
survey was conducted by the admins and it was found that YY students 
were interested in taking up the MATH-1 course.

Find the minimum number of extra seats that the admins need to add into 
the MATH-1 course to make sure that every student who is interested in 
taking the course would be able to do so.
